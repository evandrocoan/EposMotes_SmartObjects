# Installation of EPOS 1.1

1. Firstly, to install EPOS 1.1 for the "EPOSMote II" device, download these files:
  * [File: "OpenEPOS-1.1RC.tgz" - OpenEPOS-1.1 RC tree snapshot from October 18, 2011](http://epos.lisha.ufsc.br/dl95)
  * [File: "arm-gcc-4.4.4.tar.gz" - ARM (ARM7 and others)](http://epos.lisha.ufsc.br/dl88)
1. To extract the contents of "OpenEPOS-1.1RC.tgz" file where you would like most.
1. To clone this repository where you would like most.
1. To extract the contents of "arm-gcc-4.4.4.tar" file at the directory:
  * /usr/local/arm/
    * OBS: Rename the folder "gcc-4.4.4", inside "arm-gcc-4.4.4.tar" to "gcc".
  * For instance, if you downloaded the ia32 toolchain, you should extract it at /usr/local/ia32/
    * If you do not have access to that path, you'll have to adjust the makedefs file in EPOS'
    main directory accordingly.
1. To place these environment variables bellow  to your user's bash configuration file "\~/.bashrc").
To open the "\~/.bashrc", just use a command as gedit \~/.bashrc
```
# Replace this '/PLACE/HERE/THE/PATH/TO/EPOS/PATH' by the path to folder "OpenEPOS-1.1RC"
# where you extracted the contents of the "OpenEPOS-1.1RC.tgz" file on the step 1.
export EPOS=/PLACE/HERE/THE/PATH/TO/EPOS/PATH

# This configures the system to compile the EPOS applications
export PATH=/usr/local/arm/gcc/bin:$EPOS/bin:$PATH
```

To clone this repository, just run this command bellow on your favorite script shell:
```
git clone https://github.com/evandrocoan/INE5412_EposMotesII_SmartObjects.git
```
* OBS: You need to have git installed in you system.
  * For Ubuntu based platforms, just run:
```
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install git-flow
```



## Guidelines to contributing:

1. Respect the [project coding style](CONTRIBUTING.md).
1. Make a single change per commit.
1. Make your modification compact - don't reformat source code in your request. It makes code
review more difficult.
1. Reformatting (changing of white spaces by TABs, line endings or coding style) of source code
won't be accepted. Use the [issue's tracker](https://github.com/evandrocoan/INE5412_EposMotesII_SmartObjects/issues) for your request instead.

In short: The easier the code review is, the better the chance your contribution will get accepted.



## Creating an EPOS Application

Create a new file in $EPOS/app:
* $EPOS/app/INE5412_EposMotesII_SmartObjects/helloworld.cc

```cpp
#include <utility/ostream.h>

__USING_SYS

OStream cout;

int main() {
    cout << "\n Hello World! \n";
    return 0;
}
```



## Compiling EPOS

At the directory where you installed EPOS' source code, just type:
* $ make

The system will be configured and compiled (i.e. generated) successive times for each
application found in the app directory. Both software and hardware components will be
generated according with each application needs and stored in the img directory.



## Building an EPOS Application
If you have multiple applications or multiple deployment scenarios, but want to operate
on a single one, you can specify it using the APPLICATION parameter like this:
* $ make APPLICATION=helloworld
  * OBS: You must to compile EPOS with "make" as explained above,
before to compile one single APPLICATION.

If everything goes right, you should end with something like this:
```cpp
EPOS bootable image tool

  EPOS mode: library
  Machine: cortex_m
  Model: emote3
  Processor: armv7 (32 bits, little-endian)
  Memory: 31 KBytes
  Boot Length: 0 - 0 (min - max) KBytes
  Node id: will get from the network

  Creating EPOS bootable image in "hello.img":
    Adding application "hello": done.

  Adding specific boot features of "cortex_m": done.

  Image successfully generated (52686 bytes)!
```



## Running

First of all, you'll need to install a platform specific back-end for
EPOS to run on. During development, this is usually a
[QEMU virtual machine](http://www.qemu.org/) for your target architecture
(e.g. qemu-system-i386, qemu-system-arm). Then, simply type:
* $ make [APPLICATION=<application>] run



## Extras
1. To install EPOS 2.0 for the "EPOSMote III" device, visit the LISHA official Website:
  * [EPOS 2.0 User's Guide](http://epos.lisha.ufsc.br/EPOS+2+User+Guide)
  * [Download Page](http://epos.lisha.ufsc.br/EPOS+Software)
    * OBS: You need to register/create a free account, in order to be able to see the EPOS 1.1
    or 2.0 manuals.
    * See also the [EPOS 1.1 User's Guide](http://epos.lisha.ufsc.br/EPOS+User+Guide).


The Final Practical Project (PJ) is an assessment tool designed to ensure the design skills and
implementation of modern operating systems and applications that use the services of a modern
operating system.

Over this repository, there are 2 integrated projects:

1. Integrated Control and Distributed Lamps.
1. Integrated Control and Smart Energy Plugs.

The Final Practical Project is an assessment of the type "of computer system development", and as
such includes the modeling and development of a computer program, including its basic
documentation, and is suitable for the development of cognitive skills, logical and rational
thinking, teamwork, the ability to produce a computational solution to a given problem and to
document such a solution.

* The development of a computational system itself is evaluated in four (4) criteria:
  1. Schedule compliance;
  1. Scientific methodology and detailed in the description of the system and presentation of the
  conceptual model (software engineering);
  1. Correct implementation, or correctly executes and displays the results without crashes or
  unexpected behavior, including the specified interface;
  1. Presentation and defense team members. Please note: defense is an integral part of development.
